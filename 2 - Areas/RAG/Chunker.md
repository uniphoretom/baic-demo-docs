In the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), **chunking** refers to the process of breaking down large documents or datasets into smaller, manageable pieces called "chunks." These chunks make it easier and more efficient for language models to retrieve and process relevant information to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

Key points about chunking in RAG:

- It helps overcome token limits of large language models by working with smaller text segments.
- Chunks should balance granularity and coherence: too small chunks may lose context, too large chunks may dilute relevance.
- Chunking can be fixed-length (simple, but may break context) or dynamic/semantic (adapted to natural breaks or meaning).
- Overlapping chunks or adding metadata can preserve important context and improve retrieval precision.
- Effective chunking strategies increase retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and computational efficiency for RAG systems.

In essence, chunking is a fundamental technique in RAG that optimizes how external knowledge is organized and retrieved to support better AI-generated outputs[1][2][3][4].
