In the context of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data preparation, **enrichment** refers to the process of **enhancing your data by adding additional, relevant information, context, or metadata** from various sources, both internal and external[1][7]. This makes the data more useful and valuable for retrieval and generation tasks, and can help the AI system generate more accurate, grounded, and context-aware responses.

Enrichment can include:
- Adding explanations for acronyms, definitions for domain-specific jargon, or extra context to ambiguous passages.
- Integrating metadata such as document type, author, timestamp, or topic labels.
- Supplementing content with information from external databases, spreadsheets, SaaS applications, or third-party providers.
- Enriching chunks with related context (e.g., including surrounding sentences or hierarchical relationships in document fragments)[1][7].

For RAG, enrichment ensures that when the system retrieves a data chunk, it provides the language model with enough context to understand the user query and produce high-quality outputs[1][7]. This reduces errors and hallucinations by giving models richer, more accurate information to work with.
